# Self-Evaluation

- WThis final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
** I felt better with this Objects CFU than with the functions statement cfu!  Just have to remember to take breaks when needed
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
** I need to be more conscious of taking breaks!
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
** All of it!
